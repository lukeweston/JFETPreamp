JFETPreamp 

This board does not include a high voltage bias tee - the bias tee and blocking capacitor needs to be before the signal reaches this board, with no HV component!
To get the desired 0-10V output from the amplifier there will need to be a 10V supply voltage, but a smaller supply voltage of say 5V is acceptable if the desired output amplitude is sufficiently small.
